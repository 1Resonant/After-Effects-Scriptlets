# After-Effects-Scriptlets
These are small After Effects scripts I've written to help with common motion graphics &amp; video tasks. Any borrowed code is attributed to the source as best I could find. Scripts are provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied. In no event shall I be held liable for any damages arising in any way from the use of these scripts.
