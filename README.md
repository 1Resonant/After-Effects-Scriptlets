# After Effects Scripts

These are small After Effects scripts I've written to help with common motion graphics and video tasks. They are intended as free resources to benefit the After Effects community. I feel fortunate to have had this knowledge shared with me and I hope you will find it just as useful, either as a user or in writing scripts of your own. Any borrowed code is attributed to it's original source to the best of my ability. 

Disclaimer: All scripts are provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied. In no event shall I be held liable for any damages arising in any way from the use of these scripts. They were not written for profit but for utility and shared with that in mind.

## How to Use These Scripts

**Running from the File menu**

Within After Effects, you can run any of these scripts natively via _File > Scripts > Run Script..._

**Running from a Keyboard Shortcut**

1. Choose File > Scripts > Install Script File... and choose the script file.
2. Restart After Effects and the script will appear in the _File > Scripts_ menu.
3. Go to _Edit > Keyboards Shortcuts_ to open the keyboard shortcut editor.
4. Search "scripts" in the lefthand search or twirl through _Application > File > Scripts_ to see the script listed.
5. Assign a shortcut combo to the script.

_NOTE: Some of these scripts make use of keyboard modifiers in their own code, so their functions may not work as expected when mapped to a keyboard shortcut which also requires a modifier key._

**Using a Third-Party Launcher**

Not all of these scripts are intented to work with a launcher, but most can be. Here is a list of commonly-used script launchers for After Effects:

  * [KBar](https://www.aescripts.com/kbar)
  * [Quick Menu 2](https://www.aescripts.com/quick-menu)
  * [Tool Launcher](https://www.aescripts.com/tool-launcher)
  * [ft-toolbar](https://www.aescripts.com/ft-toolbar) (is now deprecated)

Personally, I like KBar and Quick Menu 2 as they've been a good fit for my workflow. Try them out and find what works best for you!
